You (or \"". gethostbyaddr($_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']) . "\" [". $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] . "]) recently
requested the password for your distributed.net stats account.  You
should keep this information confidential.  If you did not just request
your password, it just means that some confused person has clicked on
the \"mail me my password\" link on your personal stats page.  This is
no reason to be alarmed, they cannot get to your password this way.

 Your password: $pass

You may edit your personal information by visiting:

 https://stats.distributed.net/participant/pedit.php?id=$id&pass=$pass

If you'd prefer to not have your id/password revealed in the http logs
(this is a concern if you use a proxy), you can simply use the
url:

 https://stats.distributed.net/participant/pedit.php

You will be prompted for your email address and password.  Note, you
should use your ID # as the 'username' when using this
method of authentication.
